## Introduction
Customer support is an essential function for businesses aiming to maintain high satisfaction levels. However, managing customer inquiries efficiently and effectively poses significant challenges, particularly when dealing with large volumes of queries. In this blog, we build an AI-powered customer support agent using LangGraph. This agent categorizes queries, analyzes sentiment, and provides tailored responses, improving customer satisfaction while reducing response times.

---

## Background

LangGraph is a workflow orchestration library designed to integrate seamlessly with large language models (LLM) tools. By leveraging LangGraph, we can create dynamic, scalable workflows that adapt to diverse customer interaction scenarios. For this project, I'm using the Qwen 2.5 language model to power categorization, sentiment analysis, and response generation tasks.

### The Approach

The customer support agent follows a structured workflow:

- State Management: A TypedDict-based framework tracks the state of each interaction.

- Query Categorization: Incoming queries are classified into predefined categories—Technical, Billing, or General.

- Sentiment Analysis: Emotional tone is analyzed to determine the appropriate response style or escalation needs.

- Response Generation: Contextually relevant replies are generated in the query’s language.

- Escalation Mechanism: Queries with negative sentiment are routed to human agents for personalized attention.

- Workflow Graph: LangGraph orchestrates the workflow, ensuring efficient and dynamic query handling.

### Implementation
For a detailed implementation, including code examples, please refer to the accompanying Jupyter notebook available on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dgarciarieckhof/agentic.ai/blob/master/notebook/customer_support.ipynb). The notebook provides:

- Step-by-step setup instructions for the environment.

- Definitions for state management and workflow structure.

- Detailed examples of query categorization, sentiment analysis, and response generation.

- LangGraph workflow construction and testing.

## Conclusion

This AI-powered customer support agent exemplifies the synergy of natural language processing and workflow automation. By categorizing queries, analyzing sentiment, and generating responses dynamically, this solution significantly enhances efficiency and customer satisfaction. The modularity of LangGraph ensures scalability and adaptability for future improvements, such as supporting additional languages or more complex query handling scenarios.

Building systems like this demonstrates the transformative power of AI in streamlining customer interactions and improving service quality.
