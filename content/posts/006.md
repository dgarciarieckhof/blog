We all know how overwhelming the internet can be. Whether I’m trying to find the latest news, shop for something cool, or just look up fun facts, I often find myself frustrated by endless scrolling and too many clicks. That’s when I thought, *Wouldn’t it be great if I had a helper that could handle all that for me?* 

## What Makes It Special

Here’s what I found interesting about my web assistant:

- It’s like having someone who always knows the fastest way to find what you’re looking for. It scans the page, identifies key elements, and then clicks, scrolls, or types as needed.
- Whether it’s handling basic clicks or navigating complex menus, it adapts seamlessly to different websites.
- Even though there’s a lot going on behind the scenes, it provides a smooth, hassle-free browsing experience.

## How It Works

1. **The Planner**  
   I start by telling it what I need—whether it’s finding the best deals online or looking up a quick fact. The assistant formulates a simple plan to achieve the goal.

2. **The Navigator**  
   Next, it analyzes the website, identifying key elements like buttons, menus, and forms. It’s almost like it’s saying, *“Okay, here’s what I see, and here’s what I can do next!”*

3. **The Doer**  
   Finally, it takes action—clicking the right spots, scrolling through the page, and even backtracking if needed. And the best part? It keeps me informed every step of the way.


## Watch It in Action!

I’m also putting together a demo video so you can see the assistant in action—watching it navigate websites, interact with different elements, and deliver results with ease (or not!).

## Wrapping Up

A web browsing assistant can make online navigation smoother and more efficient. It’s like having a personal helper that understands what you need and does all the clicking, scrolling, and navigating for you. However, we’re not quite *there* yet. There’s still plenty of room for improvement—especially in crafting better solutions and enhancing multimodal LLMs.  

This was a quick experiment, and there’s a lot of potential to refine the workflow. Feel free to explore and experiment using some of the resources below:
